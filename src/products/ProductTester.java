package products;


//BONUS #1
//        Create a package called products that will hold all the classes for this bonus.
//
//        Create a class called ProductTester with a main method to test out the following...
//        Create a class of Product (this will be the parent class)
//        - add a few properties and methods appropriate for a product a company may offer
//        Create the following child classes: Item, Service, Subscription
//        - include a few additional properties and methods unique to each subclass
//        - override at least one method
//        - add an additional method that will call a parent method that has been overridden
//        Add a static property to ProductTester called products that will hold product objects.
//
//        Add a static method called addProduct in the ProductTester class that will create a
//        Product object based on a string name of the product subclass passed in to the method and create
//        a new array with the current product objects plus the new product object and store the array in
//        the products property on the ProductTester class
//
//Add another static method to ProductTester called productCount that will return the number of
//        elements in the products array.
